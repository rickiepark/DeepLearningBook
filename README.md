MIT Deep Learning Book in PDF format

Update: we just added a section [[Deep Learning Papers]](DeepLearningPapers.md) to this repository. We feel it complements very well the intention of this repository that is to help students to get all the relevant information about deep learning in one place.

This book was downloaded in HTML form and conviniently joined as a single PDF file for your enjoyment. Please notice the known issues in the web page, especially with regards to some symbols not rendering well or not at all.

For questions regarding the contents of the book, we encourage you to ask them on the book's forum
